2019/6/8	Domain Adaptive Dialog Generation via Meta Learning	ACL 2019	Domain adaptation is an essential task in dialog system building because there are so many new dialog tasks created for different needs every day. Collecting and annotating training data for these new tasks is costly since it involves real user interactions. We propose a domain adaptive dialog generation method based on meta-learning (DAML). DAML is an end-to-end trainable dialog system model that learns from multiple rich-resource tasks and then adapts to new domains with minimal training samples. We train a dialog system model using multiple rich-resource single-domain dialog data by applying the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to dialog domain. The model is capable of learning a competitive dialog system on a new domain with only a few training examples in an efficient manner. The two-step gradient updates in DAML enable the model to learn general features across multiple tasks. We evaluate our method on a simulated dialog dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance, which is generalizable to new tasks.	@inproceedings{Qian2019DomainAD, title={Domain Adaptive Dialog Generation via Meta Learning}, author={Kun Qian and Zhou Yu}, booktitle={Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics}, year={2019}, url={https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182952555} }		https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03520
2019/9/3	How to Build User Simulators to Train RL-based Dialog Systems	EMNLP 2019	User simulators are essential for training reinforcement learning (RL) based dialog models. The performance of the simulator directly impacts the RL policy. However, building a good user simulator that models real user behaviors is challenging. We propose a method of standardizing user simulator building that can be used by the community to compare dialog system quality using the same set of user simulators fairly. We present implementations of six user simulators trained with different dialog planning and generation methods. We then calculate a set of automatic metrics to evaluate the quality of these simulators both directly and indirectly. We also ask human users to assess the simulators directly and indirectly by rating the simulated dialogs and interacting with the trained systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for user simulator study and provides a better understanding of the pros and cons of different user simulators, as well as their impacts on the trained systems.	@inproceedings{Shi2019HowTB, title={How to Build User Simulators to Train RL-based Dialog Systems}, author={Weiyan Shi and Kun Qian and Xuewei Wang and Zhou Yu}, booktitle={Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing}, year={2019}, url={https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202540313} }		https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01388

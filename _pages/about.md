Kun Qian is a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, working with [Zhou Yu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/). As a member of the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/people.cgi), he mainly focuses on natural language generation and conversationa AI. Particularly, his research is about building task-oriented dialogue systems with limited resources. Prior to Columbia University, he achieved his B.S. in Physics from Nanjing University and M.S. in Electrial and Computer Engineering from Johns Hopkins University.

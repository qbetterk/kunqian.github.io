excerpt: 'A commonly observed problem of the state-of-the-art natural language technologies, such as Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri, is that their services do not extend to most developing countries&apos; citizens due to language barriers. Such populations suffer due to the lack of available resources in their languages to build NLP products. This paper presents AllWOZ, a multilingual multi-domain task-oriented customer service dialog dataset covering eight languages: English, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese, Hindi, French, Portuguese, and Thai. Furthermore, we create a benchmark for our multilingual dataset by applying mT5 with meta-learning.'

A commonly observed problem of the state-of-the-art natural language technologies, such as Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri, is that their services do not extend to most developing countries&apos; citizens due to language barriers. Such populations suffer due to the lack of available resources in their languages to build NLP products. This paper presents AllWOZ, a multilingual multi-domain task-oriented customer service dialog dataset covering eight languages: English, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese, Hindi, French, Portuguese, and Thai. Furthermore, we create a benchmark for our multilingual dataset by applying mT5 with meta-learning.
